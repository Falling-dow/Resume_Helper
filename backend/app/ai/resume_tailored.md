*Nov 2024 – Feb 2025*  
- Analyzed a 29% decrease in daily loan disbursement using Hive and Python, identified model drift issues, and proposed strategy adjustments that restored disbursement stability.  
- Engineered a feature selection pipeline with SQL and Python, integrating multi-source data and selecting 200+ predictive variables to enhance pre-loan risk model discrimination.  
- Constructed APP-behavior risk features and trained models including logistic regression, achieving KS=0.23 and deriving implementable risk control rules.

**Chuan Shan Private Equity Fund**, Machine Learning & Quant Research Intern  
*Jan 2024 – May 2024*  
- Optimized prediction accuracy using ensemble methods like XGBoost and Bayesian optimization.
