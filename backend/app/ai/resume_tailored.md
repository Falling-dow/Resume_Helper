## Experience
**Credit Risk Strategy Intern** | Alipay - Huabei Credit Team | May 2025 – Aug 2025  
- Built credit risk monitoring reports and analyzed key metrics including FPD and delinquency rates to support data-driven decision-making.  
- Conducted root-cause analysis on approval rates, implementing strategies that increased simplified signing approval from 89.9% to 97.3% and standard signing from 30.3% to 45.0%.  
- Designed and implemented a credit line growth strategy for 16.55M users, resulting in reduced delinquency rates and potential exposure of CNY 80.3B (USD 11.2B).  

**Financial Risk Control Strategy Intern** | KN Group | Nov 2024 – Feb 2025  
- Analyzed a 29% drop in daily loan disbursement using Hive and Python, identifying model drift and verification issues, and proposed adjustments to restore stability.  
- Engineered a feature selection pipeline integrating multi-source data with SQL and Python, selecting 200+ predictive variables to enhance pre-loan risk model discrimination.  
- Developed APP-behavior risk features and trained logistic regression and decision tree models, achieving KS=0.23 and deriving implementable risk control rules.  

**Machine Learning & Quant Research Intern** | Chuan Shan Private Equity Fund | Jan 2024 – May 2024  
- Optimized prediction accuracy using ensemble methods like XGBoost and LightGBM, with hyperparameter tuning via Bayesian optimization.  
- Engineered a high-performance backtesting framework that reduced runtime from 4 hours to 35 minutes and improved annualized return by 4.2%.
